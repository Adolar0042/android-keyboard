# FUTO Keyboard

The goal is to make a good keyboard that doesn't spy on users. This repository is a fork of [LatinIME (the Android Open-Source Keyboard)](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/inputmethods/LatinIME)

Eventual goals:
* Improve upon various aspects of the keyboard, such as theming
* Integrated voice input
* Transformer language model instead of n-gram
* On-device finetuning of language model(?)
